        <p>Hi I'm Vibek, I am a Computer Engineer from India. I love to code and develop stuff, and the proficiency of my problem solving abilities and my knowledge about different algorithms and data-structures are developing each day. Algorithms arn't arbiters of objective truth and fairness simply because they're math. I'm skilled in Backend Development, Deep Learning, Computer Vision. I've participated in a lot of Hackathons, even went to finals of the Smart India Hackathon 2018. I love doing sport programming too, its like a playground where you can divulge all your knowledge of different algorithms and data structures and optimising or amortising the complexity of the solution. My inspiration is Elon Musk because of the 'actual awesome' work he's been doing for the humanity. So I wake up and do my bit, try to set that and right shift that bit everyday so that it stays significant and I'd love to buy y'all coders coffee.</p>
